Here we use getters and setters to access the private fields called age and name.

Using setter we make sure that the age is not negative. 

set {age = value;} takes input from an object and assigns it to private field called age. 
We modify the condition in the syntax of setter property to only take possitive values using if condition.
If negative age is entered the variable wont be assigned that value. Instead it prints "Invalid age".
